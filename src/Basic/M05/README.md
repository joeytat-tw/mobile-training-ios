# Debugging

Debugging is something really important on all platforms and need to keep learning. Xcode provide bunch of tools to debugging. Eg. Breakpoints, Variable views, Callstack, Debugging console, Memory Graph and so on.

## Breakpoints

Breakpoints are some points app will stop running. And show the current state of the application. It's the most useful tool and mostly used when we debug the app.
